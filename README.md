# Creation of a package : PLS Regression for the classement

### DESCRIPTION

This project is part of our training in Data Science at the University of Lyon 2.  The main objective is to reproduce differents outputs of the PLSDA Regression for the classement and to display them in a R Shiny Application. 

The PLS (Partial Least Square) Regression is a machine learning method which was born in the early 1980s. This regression maximizes the variance of the predictors Xi and the correlation between the X (explanatory variables) and Y (the target varaible). This method borrows its process from both principal components analysis and linear regression. Here are the different functionalities of our package that we will present in the following lines :

* Installation of our package 
* The fit function 
  - Print overcharge 
  - Summary overcharge
* The predict function
* Plots
  - Components choice  
  - Individual plot 
  - Principal Components Analysis
 
#### Installation of our package 

### The fit function 

First of all, you can launch the fit fonction
